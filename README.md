# Data Preprocessing and Visualization Project

Welcome to the Data Preprocessing and Visualization Project! This repository contains Python scripts, datasets, and visual/json outputs generated from these projects. The primary focus is 
on converting flat files into rich, nested structures using Python.

Throughout this project, I carried out various data preprocessing tasks, including cleaning, transforming, and refining raw datasets for analysis, paying special attention to error handling
and filling missing data to ensure the integrity of this analyses.

To gain deeper insights into the data, I made use of visualization tools like Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Pandas in Python. By combining univariate plots like histograms for checking 
distribution and bivariate plots such as scatterplots, I was able to identify hidden patterns and relationships within the data.

It is important to note that the dataset used for this project has been curated to simulate real-world scenarios and challenges while maintaining the privacy and confidentiality of 
individuals' information.
